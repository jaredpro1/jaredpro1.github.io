        <h2 class="savedbygrace">Saved by grace.</h2>
        <p>When you are saved, you saved from eternal punishment (fire that is not going to stop). No one would probaly want to go there, think of the biggest number you can think of, a billion or a trillion, whatever the number is, longer than that the punishment will last for those who do not get saved from their sins. Matthew chapter 5 verse 29:- And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. Did you hear that, pluck out your eye, is that how bad it will be if it is better to take out an eye. But their is good news in this all!</p>
         <h4>JESUS CHRIST</h4>
         <p>John 3:16 :- For  GOD  so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten  SON , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Yes JESUS CHRIST , the SON of GOD who came on down form heaven and offered himself for us and brutally died for our sins, would you give your child or if you do not have one your brother or sister or friend to die to save a guilty person. Well GOD did that, and you are saved by faith, Ephesians 2 verses 8-9 :- 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of GOD: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. Also Luke Chapter 13 verse 3 :- I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall; all likewise perish. Although we are saved by faith is there also repentance from sin, is sin, if you do not get saved from it are you going to eternal punishment. Can someone say the sinners prayer or say they have faith or go to a church every single week but if you do not repent form sin are you going to eternal punishment. Romans chapter 8 verse 13:- For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the  Spirit  do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. Faith yes but is there also repentance.</p>
         <h2 class="sin">Sin</h2>
         <p>Romans Chapter 3 verse 23 :- For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of  GOD; . Yes, get straight to it, we need JESUS CHRIST. John Chapter 2 verse 1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the FATHER  , JESUS CHRIST the righteous. Was JESUS righteous and is it in believing on Him we can be saved. John Chapter 1 verse 9 :- If we confess our sins,  He  is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Confess your sins,  go now, don't wait you never know which message might be your last. Ask GOD to strenghten you against temptation.</p>
         <h2>Prayer</h2>
         <p>Our Father, which art, in heaven, I come towards You in the name of JESUS CHRIST. I am a sinner, and I confess all my sins... .I ask you to please have mercy on me and strenghten me against temptation and forgive me of my sins, so that I can escape everlasting punishment. Amen.</p>
