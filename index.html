   <p>If you Checked all the boxes this section is for you, <em>but</em> be warned it does not mean for you to relax or stop doing what you are doing. Passing these six basic questions could mean that you are well on your way to living a physically healthy life and avoiding a serious lifestyle disease. You can scroll down and read the table for people who did not check 4 or more boxes. Now go and drink some cranwater for checking all the boxes.</p>

   <h3>4-5 Boxes Ticked</h3>
   <p>Ok, so not all correct but you still passed the majority of questions. You may still have a lot of work to do still though depending on what boxes were not checked, espeicially if it is the BMI obese box.<strong><em>I would strongly suggest you read the table located in the people who had less than 4 boxes ticked for the boxes which you did not tick!<em></strong></p>
   <hr>
   <h3>Less than 4 Boxes Ticked!!!</h3>
   <p>Now can be a time where you get serious about your health</p>
