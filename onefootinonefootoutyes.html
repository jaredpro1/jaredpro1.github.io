        <h2>Knowing your not saved.</h2>
        <p>Having knowledge but not acting upon it, you might be scared knowing the situation you find yourself in or confused about what to do. Firstly maybe you should be panicked. Revelation Chapter 3 verse 16 :- So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,  I  will spue thee out of  my  mouth. To have the knowledge that you have but yet not following it. James Chapter 1 verse 22 :- But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p> 
        <h4>JESUS CHRIST</h4>
         <p>John 3:16 :- For  GOD  so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten  SON , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Yes JESUS CHRIST , the SON of GOD who came on down form heaven and offered himself for us and brutally died for our sins, would you give your child or if you do not have one your brother or sister or friend to die to save a guilty person. Well GOD did that, and you are saved by faith, Ephesians 2 verses 8-9 :- 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of GOD: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. Also Luke Chapter 13 verse 3 :- I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall; all likewise perish. Although we are saved by faith is there also repentance from sin, is sin, if you do not get saved from it are you going to eternal punishment. Can someone say the sinners prayer or say they have faith or go to a church every single week but if you do not repent form sin are you going to eternal punishment. Romans chapter 8 verse 13:- For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the  Spirit  do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. Faith yes but is there also repentance.</p>
         <h4>Repent, Repent , Repent</h4>
         <p>James Chapter 1 Verse 25:- But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed. Simple do what is right, it might not sound spectacular but just this thing could seperate those who are unsaved from those who are not. But if you are thinking how do I do this, well do you pray and humble yourselve before GOD? Psalm 51 verse 17:- The sacrifices of GOD are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O  GOD  , thou wilt not despise. Are you humble? Start off small maybe before you go to bed or after you wake up and ask  GOD  for mercy and to help you repent from sin. Why suffer eternal punishment for a life that may last you 80 something years. Luke 11 verses 9-10 :- 9  And I say unto you, Ask, andit shall be given you, seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 10 For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. And never stop praying and lose hope.</p>
         <h4>Read, Read , Read</h4>
         <p>How often do you read the bible? Matthew Chapter 4 verse 4 :- But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of  GOD  . / How will you know this unless you read the bible. Do you want to live and escape everlasting punishment? Well then read and not say well I read the whole bible so I know everything or do not need to read anymore, well if you are unsaved still after that think about the situation that you are in.</p>
         <h4>Pray, Pray and Prayer</h4>
         <p>Psalm 1 verse 1 :- 1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 2  But his delight is in the law of the LORD and in his law doth he meditate day and night. Look, what does it say blessed is, maybe not the man that has four cars or two houses or a big business. So pray for righteousness ways to repent. Not just for things that you might not even need. Luke Chapter 18 verses 10 - 14:- 10 Two men went into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 11  THe Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, GOD  , I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 12  I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.  13  And the publican, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,  GOD  be merciful to me a sinner.  14  Itel you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
         <p>Did you read the verses before? Humble yourself before GOD , not only that but be in a state of remorse, be crushed and be broken. Psalm 51 verse 16 -17 :- For thou desirest not sacrifice else; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.  17  The sacrifices of GOD  are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart,  O  GOD, thou wilt not despise. Look at heart and spirit. James Chapter 4 verse 9 :- Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Do you really believe, or do you just say so and are a hypocrite? Do you find it hard to read the bible or hard to pray maybe no or maybe yes but do not leave this life unsaved, do not leave this life going to everlasting punishment. if you find it hard to start, start a little by a little, one verse or two, a short pray a few sentences or a few paragraphs. Just think about how much time you could waste everyday on worldliness or pointless conversations or just trivial social media posts. If you could just take a few minutes a day and then bulid on it, at first you might think it to be hard but just take steps and you never know you might end up being addicted. Get saved from eternal punishment then worry about everything else.</p>
           <h4>Everyday, not just on the Sunday.</h4>
           <p>Is it an everyday walk, not just a once in a week walk. You might not want to hear this but every day, every minute, every second should we be acting as beleivers of JESUS CHRIST. If someone would go to church and as soon as they leave the church, they go into sin , do you think that person is living the life of a believer? If someone was to go to church maybe even once a month but during his daily life he would do what he was supposed to do as someone that is saved, like maybe he would pray, read the bible, do evangelizing, have changed ways, who do you think would be better off? Would you say it would be the person who does live the life of a saved person? John Chapter 13 verses 5 - 10 :- After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to washthe disciples' feet, and to wipe themwith the towel wherewith he was girded. 6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, LORD, dost thou wash my feet? 7  JESUS  answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now: but thou shalt know hereafter.</p> John Chapter 14 verse 6 JESUS saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Is JESUS the key, not only to come unto the  FATHER  but also to escape everlasting fire. Let us not forget JESUS in all this and having faith in him.</p>
